# Known issues found via Phase 2 test coverage

Bugs surfaced while closing test-matrix coverage gaps (Phase 2, P1). Recorded
here rather than fixed in place, per the "no further structural refactoring"
rule for this phase — each entry is a candidate for a future bug-fix task.

## `recur = 'lanczos'` + `nsp = 2` produces NaN DOS and `lmom`

- **Symptom:** with `control%recur = 'lanczos'` and `control%nsp = 2`, every
  row of `totaldos.out` is NaN in the DOS column, and `lmom` in the output
  namelist is NaN. `etot`, `ws_r`, and `mom` are unaffected (physically
  sane, match the `nsp=1` lanczos and `nsp=2` block/chebyshev runs).
- **Scope:** reproduces on both `hamiltonian%hoh = .true.` and `.false.`.
  `nsp=1` lanczos is unaffected (`totaldos.out` and `lmom` both sane).
  `nsp=2` with `recur = 'block'` or `'chebyshev'` is unaffected.
- **Likely area:** `green%sgreen()` (the lanczos-path DOS/Green's-function
  routine, dispatched from `calculation.f90`'s `recur` select-case) or the
  orbital-moment calculation in `bands.f90` — both paths presumably assume
  a code path shared with `nsp=1` that doesn't generalize to two spin
  channels.
- **Test impact:** `tests/scf/cases.json` entries `Example_bulk_bccFe_nsp2_lanczos`
  and `Example_bulk_bccFe_nsp2_lanczos_hoh` check only `etot`/`ws_r`/`mom`;
  the `totaldos.out` and `lmom` checks are intentionally omitted until this
  is fixed, so the reference doesn't pin down an all-NaN result.
- **Found:** Phase 2, P1 (adding lanczos coverage to the SCF example suite —
  this combination had zero prior test coverage under any phase).
