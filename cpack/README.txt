RS-LMTO-ASA
https://github.com/rslmto/rslmto

The RSLMTO-ASA code is a linear muffin-tin orbital (LMTO) code that uses the atomic sphere approximation (ASA) to calculate the electronic structure of materials. The code is written in Fortran and is parallelized using OpenMP. The code is capable of calculating the electronic structure of materials with a variety of different properties, including magnetic, superconducting, and topological materials. The code is freely available and can be downloaded from the GitHub repository.
