# RS-LMTO-ASA

Real-space Linearized Muffin-Tin Orbital method in the Atomic Sphere Approximation.

## New Features

### libXC Integration ðŸŽ‰

RS-LMTO-ASA now supports integration with the [libXC library](https://libxc.gitlab.io/), providing access to over 600 exchange-correlation functionals while maintaining full backward compatibility.

**Key Benefits:**
- Access to modern functionals (SCAN, B3LYP, PBE0, etc.)
- Automatic updates as new functionals are added to libXC
- Validation against standard implementations
- Optional dependency - existing calculations remain unchanged

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Build with libXC support
cmake .. -DENABLE_LIBXC=ON
make

# Use libXC functionals (txc = 1000 + libXC_ID)
echo "txc = 1135" > input.nml  # PBE via libXC
echo "txc = 1402" > input.nml  # B3LYP hybrid
```
